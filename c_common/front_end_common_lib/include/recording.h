/*! \file
 *  \brief interface for recording data into "channels" on the SDRAM in a
 *  standard way for neural models.
 *
 *  \details
 *  the API is:
 *  - recording_read_region_sizes(region_start, recording_flags,
 *            spike_history_region_size, neuron_potential_region_size,
 *            neuron_gysn_region_size):
 *      Reads the size of the recording regions - pass 0s for the region
 *       size pointer when the value is not needed
 *  - recording_is_channel_enabled(recording_flags, channel):
 *      Determines if the given channel has been initialised yet.
 *  - recording_initialse_channel(output_region, channel, size_bytes)
 *      initialises a channel with the start, end, size and current position
 *       in SDRAM for the channel handed in.
 *  - recording_record(channel, data, size_bytes);
 *      records some data into a specific recording channel.
 *  -recording_finalise():
 *      updated the first word in the recording channel's memory region with
 *       the number of bytes that was actually written to SDRAM and then closes
 *       the channel so that future records fail.
